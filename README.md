# Task 1
## Problem statement :

## TO PREDICT THE STOCK PRICE OF ANY COMPANY USING LSTM.
### ABOUT DATASET :
This dataset contains historical data of Google's stock prices and related attributes. It consists of 14 columns and a smaller subset of 1257 rows. Each column represents a specific attribute, and each row contains the corresponding values for that attribute.

# Task 2
## Problem statement :

## Titanic Classification : Algorithm which tells whether the person will be save from sinking or not
### About Dataset :
Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we have to a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

PassengerId: Passenger Identity	
Survived: Whether passenger survived or not	(0 = No, 1 = Yes)
